# NLP Specialization
My programming assignments for the natural language processing specialization provided by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera. This specialization takes approximately 16 weeks to complete.

This Specialization is designed to prepare students to design NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, create tools to translate languages and summarize text, and even build chatbots. This Specialization is designed and taught by two experts in NLP, machine learning, and deep learning. Younes Bensouda Mourri is an Instructor of AI at Stanford University who also helped build the Deep Learning Specialization. ≈Åukasz Kaiser is a Staff Research Scientist at Google Brain and the co-author of Tensorflow, the Tensor2Tensor and Trax libraries, and the Transformer paper.

This Specialization include 4 courses :

### 1. Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces

- Performed sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and na√Øve Bayes.
- Used vector space models to discover relationships between words and used PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships.
- Written  a simple English to French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality-sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbor search.


### 2. Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models

- Created a simple auto-correct algorithm using minimum edit distance and dynamic programming.
- Applied the Viterbi Algorithm for part-of-speech (POS) tagging, which is vital for computational linguistics.
- Written a better auto-complete algorithm using an N-gram language model.
- Written a Word2Vec model that uses a neural network to compute word embeddings using a continuous bag-of-words model.


### 3. Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models

- Trained a neural network with GLoVe word embeddings to perform sentiment analysis of tweets.
- Generated synthetic Shakespeare text using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) language model.
- Trained a recurrent neural network to perform named entity recognition (NER) using LSTMs with linear layers.
- Used so-called ‚ÄòSiamese‚Äô LSTM models to compare questions in a corpus and identify those that are worded differently but have the same meaning.


### 4. Natural Language Processing with Attention Models

- Translated complete English sentences into German using an encoder-decoder attention model.
- Built a Transformer model to summarize text.
- Used T5 and BERT models to perform question-answering.
- Built a chatbot using a Reformer model.
